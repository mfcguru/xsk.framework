# XSK
XSK (pronounced as X) Framework is an  iterative Agile project management framework that borrows heavily from Scrum and incorporates elements of XP and Kanban. A strong distinguishing characteristic of XSK, that also sets it apart from older Agile methodologies, is that it explicitly and strongly emphasizes software quality in general, code quality in particular, and continuous delivery is a must. What also sets XSK from Scrum specifically (and Scrumban depending on the kind of Scrumban that  you have) is the notable absence of sprints, where instead it follows a Kanban-style of managing and monitoring WIPs (work-in-progress tasks) for visualizing tasks on a daily-basis.
